task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression focuses on building a binary classification model using logistic regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting categorical outcomes. In this task, you're expected to select a suitable binary classification dataset—such as house prediction dataset—and use it to train and evaluate a logistic regression model using Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The process begins with data preprocessing steps, including splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and standardizing the feature values. Once the data is prepared, you will train a logistic regression model and make predictions on the test data. Evaluation of the model involves key metrics such as the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, all of which help in understanding the effectiveness and accuracy of the classifier.
